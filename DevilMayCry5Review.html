Devil May Cry 5 is the most complex and refined action games ever made. It can easily be considered the best action game ever made due to it's perfect combat alone. There are many other factors that make Devil May Cry 5 an action masterpiece.
<br><br>
Devil May Cry 5 follows the plot of Nero, Dante and a mysterious man called V as they fight a new demon entity called Urizen. There is more than enough fan service to satisfy returning DMC players and enough to surprise newcomers to the series. There are also many side characters returning and new who don't get as much development as the main three protagonists, but are still very enjoyable to watch interact with each other. The cutscenes have some of the best video game choreography and each old character retains their a great personality, complimented by well written and sometimes hilarious dialogue. The visuals in Devil May Cry 5 are nothing short of a spectacle, when fighting against a multitude of enemies and using weapons to their limits, is where these visuals shine. The level design is great for the most part, other than some background visuals being repeated throughout and mediocre platforming. The soundtrack and mainly battle music is consistently great throughout the game. Devil May Cry 5's production values are some of the best in any game, with only a couple of hiccups here and there.
<br><br>
There is only one thing I need to say about Devil May Cry 5's gameplay. The gameplay is perfect. The amount of variety, freedom of choice and player expression is unmatched by any game. The first playable character is Nero he is straightforward to use but offers a solid amount of variety. His gameplay consists of a shotgun, sword that can be revved up to gain stronger hits for a few seconds and his devil bringers, which are swappable arms that offer an unmatched variety of different choices, such as slowing time, riding an arm as a rocket or they can even be broken to damage enemies many enemies in the area. At the end of the game, Nero also gets his original devil arm from the DMC4, which grants even more freedom. V has the powers to summon a panther, talking bird and massive titan while he stands back and dodges attacks. V goes in for the finishing kill, but uses his summons to do all of the other damage. Dante has the most variety out of any character in Devil May Cry 5 as he has 6 different guns, 7 changeable melee weapons and 4 different styles, the only 2 styles missing are doppleganger and quicksilver. Each weapon has varied attacks move-sets and changing styles mid battle adds to the depth and even more freedom for Dante. Vergil is a dlc character, but his gameplay his also fantastic. He has three different weapons that have many abilities and can change be changed quicker than Dante's weapons due to the amount that Dante has. Vergil also has doppleganger, teleports and shoots sword projectiles that can be enhanced by the Devil Trigger gauge. Vergil has a tone of variety and if played well using all his weapons to his advantage, can be unstoppable, but not unbalanced The upgrade systems are well designed as you can choose to receive new abilities, weapon moves, health bars or devil trigger gauges. All playable characters, except V, allow players to have a devil trigger that enhances their abilities and changes their forms for how ever long you designate, until the gauge runs out. There is also the rank system and keeping a consistent SSS rank is still as satisfying as ever. Enemy types are fantastically designed and well balanced, as well as challenging. The great design, challenge, balance and creativity of enemies applies to bosses as well. My personal favourite boss has to be the last 2 you fight. I won't spoil anything, but these 2 bosses pay homage to previous dmc games and are greatly challenging and fun. Overall, there really isn't a flaw with Devil May cry 5's gameplay.
<br><br>
Dmc 5 is easily one of the best action games ever made. The only minor issues are its simplistic mission structure and repeated background visuals. That doesn't mean that it isn't one of the best action games ever made, because it is. <br>Devil May Cry 5 is a Jackpot in video game action.
